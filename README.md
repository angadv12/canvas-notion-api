populates a specified Notion page with the tables for each course.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Project Setup

    Name your Token, and leave the date blank to have no expiration date.

    Once the Token is generated, copy the Token string.

This string will be your **Canvas API Key**

### 3. Notion API Key Access

Pull up the [Notion - My Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) site and click `+ New Integration`

Enter the name of the integration (ie Canvas Notion Integration) and what workspace the Integration will apply to.
In the `Secrets` tab and copy the _Internal Integration Secret_ this will be your **Notion API Key**.

### 5. Environment Variable `.env` file Setup
Create a `.env` file and replace all the <> with your own information. Place the `.env` file in the `src` folder.
*Keep the `NOTION_DATABASE` variable as is because it will be overwritten when you run the code*

```
CANVAS_API_URL=<example: https://canvas-page.edu>
CANVAS_API=<your canvas api token>
NOTION_PAGE=<page id of the parent page to create the database>
NOTION_API=<your notion api key> # filled by user
NOTION_DATABASE='invalid' # filled by integration
```

> [!NOTE]
> How to Access the Key for the `NOTION_PAGE`:
> 1. On the desired Notion page, click `Share` then `ðŸ”— Copy link`
> 2. Paste the link down, example url: notion.so/{name}/{page}-**0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv**?{otherstuff}
> 3. Copy the string of 32 letter and number combination to the `.env` file

### 6. Run Code

```zsh
cd src
node main.js
```

> [!NOTE]
> To see updates in your Notion tables, you need to rerun the script, which checks for new assignments for each course.
